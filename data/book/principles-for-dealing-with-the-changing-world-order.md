summary: "From legendary investor Ray Dalio, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Principles , who has spent half a century studying global economies and markets, Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order examines history's most turbulent economic and political periods to reveal why the times ahead will likely be radically different from those we've experienced in our lifetimes--but similar to those that have happened many times before."
